HEY ALL 😊 ! Welcome To Drum-O-Drum 🥁.

I have Created A Music Website🎧, In Which You Can Click The Buttons 🖱️ Or Use Keypad ⌨️ To Play The Music ♫ .. This Website Has Been Created Using HTML , CSS & Javascript.

In This Repository I Have Added A Image Folder 📁, Where You Can See All The Images 🖼️ I,ve Used In My Website.

I've Also Added Sound Folder Where You Can Hear All The Sounds That I Added In My Website.

Secondly There Is A Public Folder 📁,In That Folder I've Stored My .css File📄 & .js File📄. You Can Go Through It.

In That Same Public Folder Ive Added An Image Name Called Favicon Which Will Be The Icon Image At The Top Of My Website 🌐 Near The Title Tag.

Coming Down You Can See My index.html📄 File Where I've Stored All The Elements In It.

I've Used HTML For Writing My Content , CSS For Styling And Javascript For Functioning.

I've Given The Link Below To See My Whole Website 👇.
